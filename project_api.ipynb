This is not an official senior community, but there are many seniors here and only a handful use the pool regularly. Grandchildren can often be found at the pool, and our grandchildren love playing with them. Our tennis courts are excellent, two of them were resurfaced just a few years ago by the best company in Denver. The third court is a har-true surface.  The clubhouse can be used by residents and guests unless it has been reserved. Two large TV's and comfy couches and chairs beckon.
